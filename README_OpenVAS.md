# 🛡️ Vulnerability Assessment using OpenVAS

This project demonstrates a full vulnerability assessment performed using **OpenVAS** on a Kali Linux VM. The results are documented and submitted as part of a cybersecurity lab assignment.

## ✅ Task Checklist

1. ✅ Installed **OpenVAS** on Kali Linux.
2. ✅ Set scan target to **localhost (127.0.0.1)**.
3. ✅ Launched a **full vulnerability scan** using "Full and Fast" configuration.
4. ✅ Waited for scan to complete (~7 minutes in this case).
5. ✅ Reviewed the scan report for vulnerabilities and their severity.
6. ✅ Researched simple fixes for identified vulnerabilities.
7. ✅ Documented the most critical vulnerability (1 medium-severity issue found).
8. ✅ Included screenshots in the final submission (to be added manually).

## 📄 Files Included

- `OpenVAS_Scan_Report_Kali.docx` – Full report with scan summary, key findings, and placeholders for screenshots.
